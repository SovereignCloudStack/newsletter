      After 6 labor-intensive months, yet another release day is waiting around
      the corner. SCS R2 (<em>also known as Awesome Arvid among aficionados</em>) 
      will officially be published next <b>Wednesday, March 23</b>.
      We will use the team meetings next week to clean up the board. The following
      week, we will have a retrospective to celebrate the successes of the past
      sprints and discuss what can be improved. <b>Please take yourself a few minutes
      and give us a KISS: What should be (K)ept, (I)mproved, (S)tarted or (S)topped?</b>

      Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th
      and we are once again involved!. In our <em>ACME</em> track,
      a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped. The goal of this track is
      to demonstrate a green-field approach in which a Cloud provider infrastructure
      is created from bare metal; our core focus is to provide extended
      self-descriptions for the new Cloud provider and to challenge/sketch
      on-boarding processes.
