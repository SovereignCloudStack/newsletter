Dear Community, I dearly hope your summer went better then a-ha´s "Summer moved on" and you are using the time where customers are on vacation or arrived relaxed. This time is important to calm down and gather strength again. Because this autumn will be exiting, communicative, eventfull, and new. I wish you a pleasant and relaxed summertime! Friederike

All teams are making progress, this SIG will collect this progess for the next big release. Interested? Than join the SIG Release.

Sustainable Infrastructure

Meet us at the OCP Europe Meetup: Sustainable infrastructure and open hardware deployment in Europe - 05.09.2023. This event broachs the issue of sustainable open source technology: hardware and with us also software - only the conscious use of both will lead to real sustainability, as sustainable digitization could be.

Always worth it

The values of transparency and sharing knowledge are leading to a very active community and a constantly re-filling blog. The latest posts are about SCS as Cloud in a Box. And a re-evaluation of the air-gapped installation. Always worth a read!

Move for Good

There is still room for new sports mates, no matter how far you run, walk, swim, or cycle - every kilometer counts for the good reason: we donate all money to a project which provides devices and knowledge to refugies and their children. Get up your butts.
