  Community,
  
  <p>did you also feel like you had a "Call for Participation" marathon last weeks? 
  We are probably all in the process of preparing for upcoming (on-site) events

  looking forward to? </p>
  We would like to start planning this year's SCS Community Summit and find the
  ideal opportunity. Please take a few seconds to fill out the following survey.
