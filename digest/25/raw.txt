Self-service for test and development cloud resources

As discussed and planned during the last Community Hackathon, we want to simplify how you can obtain free test and development resources for all of your various SCS-related projects. PlusServer made a great step ahead and switched to this new approach. Add yourself to the table linked below and open a pull request â€“ it's now easy as that!
