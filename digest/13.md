intro: |-
  Community,
  <p>we did it! Our third release of Sovereign Cloud Stack has been published last week
  and we're still thrilled about the high level of commitment from our community.
  Thank you for making Release 2 the "most stress-free release" [sic!]</p>
  <p>Did we already announce that we're planning a super-secret party to honor all
  your contributions to the success of SCS? No? Well... stay tuned! This little
  we can already tell you so far: we'll enter a spaceship. ðŸš€</p>

    Recent news on the lack of funding for five more German Gaia-X projects has
    contributed to public uncertainty about the future of the pan-European project.
    However, we are not affected by the recent budget cuts, but continue with full
    energy.

      After some very good discussions we have finally defined a Code of Conduct.
      The final document is linked below. We're now also on the list of
      projects that are committed to the Contributor Covenant. Thank you all for
      fostering our standards and establishing a welcoming contributor's experience.

      We will use the team meetings in the upcoming weeks to either look back at
      the past sprints and have a retrospective (team 2) or turn our attention to
      our vision for R3 (team 1 & 3). Please see Kurt's email for more details. In addition,
      Felix sent an email requesting for comments on the future scope of our SIGs.
      Please take yourself a minute to complete the below linked poll.
