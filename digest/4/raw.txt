Community, I'm sure you've sorely missed our Community Digest and wondered why you haven't received any more issues. Don't worry, this newsletter has not been discontinued. On the contrary, it has even been further developed! You can now contribute announcements or interesting stories by simply committing to our newsletter repository. We're looking forward to receiving your input on articles worth reading, announcements about your newest SCS community blog post or friendly reminders of upcoming events. What do you think of the revised newsletter format? Any feedback is very welcome. We hope you enjoy reading!

Welcome on board, Felix!

What couldn't be a better occasion for an HTML-based newsletter than this great announcement? We are incredibly excited to announce Felix joining the SCS team at the OSBA as the product owner for IaaS & Ops. Hip hip hooray!

Zuul workshop

Based on the discussion within Team 2, we would like to spend some time next Monday (2022-01-31) 15:00 CET to understand our Zuul-based CI infrastructure better and make plans how to better leverage it. By the way: Did you know that Zuul's ten year anniversary is coming up in May 2022, and to celebrate, Tristan Cacqueray from Red Hat created a visualization of the Zuul git repository over the past ten years.
