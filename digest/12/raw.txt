Community, what a week - yet again, huh? This week you can enjoy two community digests. Something special must have happened, right? Exactly! Today is release day and we honor it with a special issue of this newsletter! Open the champagne, pop the corks, and toast with us!

SCS R2 released

Hip hip hooray! Thanks to a tireless and dedicated community, we are proud to announce the release of SCS R2 (Awesome Arvid)! Thank you for everyone's support! Without you this release would not have been possible. The German magazine iX/heise has already reported on R2, and more coverage is sure to follow. Please spread the word and nag your fellow followers with this great announcement.

Future directions - the road towards R3

Yet, this does not mean that we are resting on our laurels. Felix has written an excellent post about the future directions of SCS towards R3, which you can now read in our community blog. We look forward to seeing you at the team meetings!

Solidarity with Ukraine

The Russian government's war against Ukraine is a criminal attack on inalienable human rights, on the freedom, right to self-determination and security of every person in Ukraine and on peace in Europe. Without freedom and peace, our work is also impossible; development and innovation require peaceful, global cooperation. Our thoughts are with our friends in Ukraine and all those who have fled.
