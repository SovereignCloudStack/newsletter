  Community,<br/><br/>
  
  I'm sure you've sorely missed our Community Digest and wondered why you
  haven't received any more issues. Don't worry, this newsletter has not been 
  discontinued. On the contrary, it has even been further developed!<br/><br/>
  You can now contribute announcements or interesting stories by simply committing
  to our <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/newsletter" 
  target="_blank">newsletter repository</a>. We're looking forward to receiving
  your input on articles worth reading, announcements about your newest SCS 
  community blog post or friendly reminders of upcoming events.<br/><br/>
  What do you think of the revised newsletter format? Any feedback is very welcome.
  We hope you enjoy reading!

    What couldn't be a better occasion for an HTML-based newsletter than this 
    great announcement? We are incredibly excited to announce Felix joining the 
    SCS team at the OSBA as the product owner for IaaS & Ops. Hip hip hooray!

      <b>Based on the discussion within Team 2, we would like to spend some time 
      next Monday (2022-01-31) 15:00 CET to understand our Zuul-based CI 
      infrastructure better and make plans how to better leverage it.</b><br/><br/>
      By the way: Did you know that Zuul's ten year anniversary is coming up in 
      May 2022, and to celebrate, Tristan Cacqueray from Red Hat created a 
      visualization of the Zuul git repository over the past ten years.
