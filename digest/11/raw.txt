Community, after 6 labor-intensive months, yet another release day is waiting around the corner. SCS R2 (also known as Awesome Arvid among aficionados) will officially be published next Wednesday, March 23. We will use this week's team meetings to clean up the board. The following week, we will have a retrospective to celebrate the successes of the past sprints and discuss what can be improved. Please take yourself a few minutes and give us a KISS: What should be (K)ept, (I)mproved, (S)tarted or (S)topped?

Gaia-X Hackathon #3

Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th and we are once again involved!. In our ACME track, a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped.
