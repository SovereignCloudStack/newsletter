    You're complaints have been heard. We decided to move to GitHub projects in
    order to have an unique entry point for our contributors. The upcoming release
    will be planned in the public "Sovereign Cloud Stack R3" project on GitHub.
    With this attempt we hope not only to reduce the number of tools, but also
    to make our work more transparent and traceable!
