Wallaby Update Experience

Since more then one year plusserver has provided the Sovereign Cloud Stack Community Environment which is based on osism OpenStack Distrubution. This testbed is used intensively for our development work, tests, demonstrations, or events such as the last two  Gaia-X Hackathons.  Mathias, Markus and Toens started the OpenStack Wallaby upgrade in early December 2021 and just published a blog post on their upgrade experience.  Check out our community blog to find out what problems they ran into and what the current status is!
