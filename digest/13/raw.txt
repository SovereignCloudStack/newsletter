Community, we did it! Our third release of Sovereign Cloud Stack has been published last week and we're still thrilled about the high level of commitment from our community. Thank you for making Release 2 the "most stress-free release" [sic!] Did we already announce that we're planning a super-secret party to honor all your contributions to the success of SCS? No? Well... stay tuned! This little we can already tell you so far: we'll enter a spaceship. ðŸš€

The Gaia-X foundation is solid

Recent news on the lack of funding for five more German Gaia-X projects has contributed to public uncertainty about the future of the pan-European project. However, we are not affected by the recent budget cuts, but continue with full energy.

SCS adopts Contributor Covenant

After some very good discussions we have finally defined a Code of Conduct. The final document is linked below. We're now also on the list of projects that are committed to the Contributor Covenant. Thank you all for fostering our standards and establishing a welcoming contributor's experience.

After the game is before the game

We will use the team meetings in the upcoming weeks to either look back at the past sprints and have a retrospective (team 2) or turn our attention to our vision for R3 (team 1 & 3). Please see Kurt's email for more details. In addition, Felix sent an email requesting for comments on the future scope of our SIGs. Please take yourself a minute to complete the below linked poll.
