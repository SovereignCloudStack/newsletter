Community, the new year has hardly begun and we are already busy planning this year's events. We do hope so much to meet you physically after the many months of virtual collaboration. Whether OpenInfra Summit in Berlin or Cloud Expo in Frankfurt, we will be there and hope to see you as well! Let's finally toast together and celebrate the many successes of the past year. What are your plans for 2022? Is there an event you are most looking forward to and where will we be able to spot you?



We learn better together. Let's build knowledge together and make our work transparent. Next Thursday, February 10, we will enjoy a short introduction to Tempest and Rally by Mathias and Felix. Join us directly after the weekly overall meeting at 15:45 CET.
