Gaia-X Hackthon #3

Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th and we are once again involved!. In our ACME track, a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped. The goal of this track is to demonstrate a green-field approach in which a Cloud provider infrastructure is created from bare metal; our core focus is to provide extended self-descriptions for the new Cloud provider and to challenge/sketch on-boarding processes.

On the following Thursday, March 10, Felix will present what the Monitoring SIG has been working on in the last months. This much I can tell you: Men who stare at dashboards.
