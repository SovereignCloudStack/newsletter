Dear Community, for more than two months I have been part of the SCS team now. These were eventful months with a lot of impressions, experiences and learnings like PR which meens obviously Pull request (and not press release as I was used to...) Thank you all for welcoming me with such open arms! It was and is a pleasure to meet you. You all give me time and space to grow, to learn, to shape the project and the community. Stay save and healthy! Best wisches, Friederike

Looking for a valued aim

During the last two years the SCS community was very successful in achieving sporting goals in the SCS run and the SCS Triathlon. This year we want to continue. The idea is that we want to make a sponsored run/walk/ride/swim. Sponsors confirm to give a little sum for each 10 kilometers which were run (or every 20 km walk and so on) and we donate the collected money to a social project or initiative. This project or initiative should be connected with SCS topics or values. Do you know a project or initiative which is worth to be gifted? Please send us your ideas! Post them in our Matrix channel with #socialsport and a description of the project or initiative. Later we will have a poll with your guesses.
