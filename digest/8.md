    Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th
    and we are once again involved!. In our <em>ACME</em> track,
    a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped. The goal of this track is
    to demonstrate a green-field approach in which a Cloud provider infrastructure
    is created from bare metal; our core focus is to provide extended
    self-descriptions for the new Cloud provider and to challenge/sketch
    on-boarding processes.
