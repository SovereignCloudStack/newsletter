intro: |-
  Community,
  
  <p>with big steps we are moving towards the release of R2, which will presumably
  be published on <b>March 23rd</b>. We will now use the remaining weeks to write release
  notes, create an announcement campaign, have a look at the progress of still open 
  user stories and to clean up the board together with the technical teams.</p>
  <p>We hope for your support as well as your commitment and would be happy to
  see you around in the upcoming team meetings. Let's give it all we got and make
  the upcoming release a great success for digital sovereignty in Europe and beyond!</p>
  <p>Are you in? Check our public calendar to see where you can support. Thank you!</p>

    Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th
    and we are once again involved!. In our <em>ACME</em> track,
    a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped. The goal of this track is
    to demonstrate a green-field approach in which a Cloud provider infrastructure
    is created from bare metal; our core focus is to provide extended
    self-descriptions for the new Cloud provider and to challenge/sketch
    on-boarding processes.
