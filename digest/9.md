intro: |-
  Community,
  
  <p>with big steps we are moving towards the release of R2, which will presumably
  be published on <b>March 23rd</b>. We will now use the remaining weeks to write release
  notes, create an announcement campaign, have a look at the progress of still open 
  user stories and to clean up the board together with the technical teams.</p>
  <p>We hope for your support as well as your commitment and would be happy to
  see you around in the upcoming team meetings. Let's give it all we got and make
  the upcoming release a great success for digital sovereignty in Europe and beyond!</p>
  <p>Are you in? Check our public calendar to see where you can support. Thank you!</p>

    The open hacking sessions every Friday afternoon as well as the efforts of
    the IAM SIG (Identity and Access Management Special Interest Group) are having
    an impact! For instance, the changes proposed by Arvid to get JWT bearer
    tokens working with keystone using the openstack-cli client have been accepted
    by the OSISM team. We thank everyone who contributed to this feature!
