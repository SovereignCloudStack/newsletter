  Community,<br/><br/>
  
  I'm sure you've sorely missed our Community Digest and wondered why you
  haven't received any more issues. Don't worry, this newsletter has not been 
  discontinued. On the contrary, it has even been further developed!<br/><br/>
  You can now contribute announcements or interesting stories by simply committing
  to our <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/newsletter" 
  target="_blank">newsletter repository</a>. We're looking forward to receiving
  your input on articles worth reading, announcements about your newest SCS 
  community blog post or friendly reminders of upcoming events.<br/><br/>
  What do you think of the revised newsletter format? Any feedback is very welcome.
  We hope you enjoy reading!
