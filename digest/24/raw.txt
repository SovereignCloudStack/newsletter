Call for Participation: Sovereign Cloud DevRoom at FOSDEM 2023

Join us during FOSDEM 2023 on February 4th and 5th in Brussels. Together with the Operate First community a Sovereign Cloud DevRoom is organized.

This is your chance to submit a proposal for a presentation, lightning talk or BoF-Session for this DevRoom! Possible topics of your proposal might be:  Can all operations be open, or may there be a need for a two+ tier openness (country specific laws or company secrets)? How can privacy relevant data be anonymized instead of being deleted, without losing the useful information? Open Operations is more than just sharing runbooks, how is knowledge shared and fostered best across organizations? Interoperability, transparency, and independence are the go to goals, what can be accepted on our way until we are there? Countering the risks of integrated platforms  We are looking forward to this exciting conference and to discussing Open Operations and digital sovereignty with you!
