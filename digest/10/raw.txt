Community, what a week, huh?* To pay tribute to this eventful week, this community digest's issue features 5 highlights instead of the usual 3. We're heading full throttle to the release of R2 and are in the final stages of preparation. At the same time, various events such as the Gaia-X Hackathon #3 are also coming up.
