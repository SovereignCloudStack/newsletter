Contributor's Journal #1
========================================

Teams,

as our community grows, so does the number of open issues, pull requests that
need to be reviewed, and various other to-dos. With this newsletter inspired
by our Community Digest, we would like to encourage you – our beloved
contributors – to work with us on the various open tasks. This list represents
only a subset of all action items, which we want to highlight here.

What do you think of this new format? Do you like the new journal and does it
help you to successfully contribute to SCS? Eduard is looking forward to receiving
your feedback!

Good first issues
****************************************

* Add a simple Python script to identity missing repositories
We need a simple tool that uses the GitHub API to check if there are (new) repositories that aren't yet defined in our github-manager.

Open issues
****************************************

* Transform the SCS Flavor Naming Standard into the new format for standards
Now that we have a standard on how the standards should be written, the existing standard on flavor naming needs to be adapted accordingly.

* Transform the Image Standard into the new format for standards
Now that we have a standard on how the standards should be written, the existing standard on image metadata needs to be adapted accordingly.

* Validate workflow of OpenStack Image Manager for fulfilling the image standard
We're looking for volunteers that want to play around with the OpenStack Image Manager, check whether the workflow is clear
and that the tool fulfills our own image standards.

Review needed
****************************************

Felix was so kind and add some missing meeting notes to our minutes repository. Please take a free minute and give a review to the open pull requests if you participated one of the corresponding meetings. Thank you!
