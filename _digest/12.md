      The Russian government's war against Ukraine is a criminal attack on
      inalienable human rights, on the freedom, right to self-determination and
      security of every person in Ukraine and on peace in Europe. Without freedom
      and peace, our work is also impossible; development and innovation require
      peaceful, global cooperation. Our thoughts are with our friends in Ukraine
      and all those who have fled.
