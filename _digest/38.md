  <p>Dear Community,</p>
  <p>we hope you had a wonderful summer and are now fit for our final run! This run will be longer than expected (see below), so we will have time to recap our success and shape the future for SCS and our partners. Thanks for being a part of our community!</p>
  <p> Best wishes,</p>
  <p>Friederike and the SCS team</p>

      Our Open Operations Meetup is part of the Open Operations Initiative. We want to share experiences and knowledge around and about operations of cloud technology. In our meetup we covered several topics and share them via our YouTube channel. It is very worth a visit.
