    <p>We come from building a network of operators who share knowledge on operating cloud & container infrastructure. But the topic is broader: we meet monthly with DevOps, Ops team members and all who are interested in automating and operating IT solutions in modern cloud environments. We want to talk about our practical approach, about best practices, failures and how to avoid them, setups, ... The more people are sharing their knowledge and experiences the better!</p>

      A new set of hardware CPU speculation vulnerabilities were uncovered in July/August 2023. They do create risks for information disclosure for providers and users of SCS clouds. This blog article explains the issues, the associated risks and how these can be mitigated by providers and users.

      This year our sport event is also a social event as we donate the collected money to a voluntary project which supports refugies with technical devices and knowledge. We love to share knowledge, so this is a great project to donate to. Thanks to our sponsors!

      Meet SCS at the GXFS Connect in Berlin on the 5th and 6th of September. Right from the beginning SCS and Gaia-X were strongly connected, that´s why we are happy to talk about our network for digital sovereignty and the federation services. We would love to meet you there.
