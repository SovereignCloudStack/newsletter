  Community,
  <p>you may have wondered why you haven't received further issues of this community
  digest during the last two weeks. The preparations around the <b>Cloud Expo Europe</b>
  have taken up all our time and the preparations of the <b>OpenInfra Summit</b> now follow
  seamlessly. Of course, this is no reason to let this wonderful format slide!
  Cheer up, here comes issue #16 of the SCS Community Digest with brand new information
  about our secret meetup in Berlin, an announcement of our new partner overview
  and as always a loud call to action!</p>

    Many of us will be at the <b>OpenInfra Summit</b> in Berlin next month. What a
    great opportunity to gather as a community for a beer, don't you think?
    We would like to say a big thank you for all your contributions during the last years
    and therefore invite you to a community party at a still secret location.
    You want to join us on the evening of <b>June 8</b> in Berlin? Great! Please
    send a short notice to Bianca (<u>hollery@osb-alliance.com</u>). We'll send you 
    more details on this meetup at end of next week. This much we can already reveal:
    the theme of our Community Summit 2021 will be continued!<br /><br />
