  text : |-
    <p>Join us during <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/">FOSDEM 2023</a> on February 4th and 5th
    in Brussels. Together with the <a href="https://www.operate-first.cloud/">Operate First</a>
    community a <i>Sovereign Cloud</i> DevRoom is organized. The Sovereign Cloud DevRoom
    is for discussing topics and issues of user privacy and sovereignty and the
    intersection with the needs of infrastructure providers in the cloud computing
    era. This is your chance to submit a proposal for a presentation, lightning talk
    or BoF-Session for this DevRoom!</p>
    <p>Possible topics of your proposal might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can all operations be open, or may there be a need for a two+ tier openness (country specific laws or company secrets)?</li>
      <li>How can privacy relevant data be anonymized instead of being deleted, without losing the useful information?</li>
      <li>Open Operations is more than just sharing runbooks, how is knowledge shared and fostered best across organizations?<li>
      <li>Interoperability, transparency, and independence are the go to goals, what can be accepted on our way until we are there?</li>
      <li>Countering the risks of integrated platforms</li>
    </ul>
    We are looking forward to this exciting conference and to discussing Open Operations and digital sovereignty with you!
