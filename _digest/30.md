    <p>Kurt wrote this document [Why do we need to standardize flavors and flavor names?](https://input.scs.community/Why-Standardized-Flavors-And-Names) to inspire the discussion around mandatory flavors, discovery and naming. But it was not clear how to best discuss it. So he opened issue [standards/#271](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/271) which links standards/#272-#283 in order to discuss the questions and collect a lot of feedback. We want to be in a position to finish the discussion in the overflow slot on May 8 - the more considerations we can collect before, the better, obviously.</p>
