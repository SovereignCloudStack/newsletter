  <p>Dear Community,</p>
  <p> for two months I have been part of the SCS team. These were eventful month with a lot of impressions, experiences and learnings like PR which meens obviously Pull request (and not press as I was used to...) Thank you all for welcoming me with such open arms! It was a pleasure to meet you. You all give me time and space to grow, to learn (GitHub...), to shape the project and the community. Stay save and healthy! Best wisches, Friederike</p>

    <p>During the last two years the SCS community was very successful in achieving sportive goals in the SCS run and the SCS Triathlon. This year we want to continue. The idea is that we want to make a sponsored run/walk/ride/swim. Sponsors confirm to give a little sum for each 10 kilometers which were run (or every 20 km walk and so on) and we donate the collected money to a social project or initiative. This project or initiative should be connected with SCS topics or values. Do you know a project or initiative which is worth to be gifted? Please send us your ideas! Post them in our Matrix channel with #socialsport and a description of the project or initiative. Later we will have a poll with your guesses.</p>

       The Call for Proposals is now open for DOST [Deutsche Open Source Tage](https://deutsche-opensource-tage.de/) in November in Berlin. SCS is an important part of the German (and not only German...) open source communities, so we would love to have a lot of talks at the conference from and about SCS. Think about submitting a talk, letÂ´s brainstorm topics, and become present at DOST.
