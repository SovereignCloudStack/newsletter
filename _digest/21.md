    <p>Have you already registered for our Community Triathlon in October? You can
    sign up for this event until the end of this week. Don't miss this year's chance
    to claim a free SCS shirt and of course having a lot of fun with us and your
    team!</p>

    <p>Are you still arguing with your mates about how to slice the teams
    or who will cover which discipline? Nevermind, you can still decide on this
    later. It is only important that you register in time, so that we can send
    out the goodies packages to you in advance. Simply leave a whitespace in the
    team field and provide your team name later during submission.</p>
