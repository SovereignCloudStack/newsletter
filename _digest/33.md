      Meet us at the OCP Europe Meetup: Sustainable infrastructure and open hardware deployment in Europe - 05.09.2023. This event broachs the issue of sustainable open source technology: hardware and with us also software - only the conscious use of both will lead to real sustainability, as sustainable digitization could be.

      The values of transparency and sharing knowledge are leading to a very active community and a constantly re-filling blog. The latest posts are about SCS as Cloud in a Box. And a re-evaluation of the air-gapped installation. Always worth a read!

      There is still room for new sports mates, no matter how far you run, walk, swim, or cycle - every kilometer counts for the good reason: we donate all money to a project which provides devices and knowledge to refugies and their children. Get up your butts.
