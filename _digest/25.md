      As discussed and planned during the last Community Hackathon, we want to simplify how
      you can obtain free test and development resources for all of your various SCS-related
      projects. PlusServer made a great step ahead and switched to this new approach. Add yourself
      to the table linked below and open a pull request â€“ it's now easy as that!
