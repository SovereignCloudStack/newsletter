  Community,
  
  <p>after 6 labor-intensive months, yet another release day is waiting around
  the corner. SCS R2 (<em>also known as Awesome Arvid among aficionados</em>) 
  will officially be published next <b>Wednesday, March 23</b>. We will use this
  week's team meetings to clean up the board. The following week, we will have a
  retrospective to celebrate the successes of the past sprints and discuss what
  can be improved. <b>Please take yourself a few minutes and give us a KISS: What
  should be (K)ept, (I)mproved, (S)tarted or (S)topped?</p>

    In the latest issue of <b>The Cloud Report</b>, Kurt, Felix, and Eduard share
    some of their thoughts on digital sovereignty and why it requires more than mere
    legal compliance. Above all, we need freedom of choice, open source and competence!
    You can now read the whole article on our SCS community blog. Any feedback on
    our ideas are greatly appreciated!

      Watch out! The third Gaia-X Hackthon will take place on March 28th and 29th
      and we are once again involved!. In our <em>ACME</em> track,
      a Gaia-X compliant provider will be bootstrapped. The goal of this track is
      to demonstrate a green-field approach in which a Cloud provider infrastructure
      is created from bare metal; our core focus is to provide extended
      self-descriptions for the new Cloud provider and to challenge/sketch
      on-boarding processes.

      After some teething problems, our Lightning Talk format has become very well

      been working on during the last months. On March 31, Jonas will showcase
      the OpenStack and SecuStack Lifecycle Management Tool <b>yaook</b> and on April 7,
      Eduard will give a quick overview of <b>jekyll</b> and how it is used to build
      the SCS website and this newsletter.
