  <p>all sails are set for the finish at the SCS Summit. This is, of course, our highlight in this Spring. But this is not our only topic! We had a wonderful fourth Community Hackathon (see below), we had a talk at the OCP Summit, we will be at the OpenInfra Days in Germany, France, Hungary, at the Cloud Expo Europe... SCS is here to stay! Be invited to stay with us!</p>
  <p> Best wishes,</p>
  <p>Friederike and the SCS team</p>

    <p>... nothing would happen! Thanks to our great sponsors of the SCS Summit 2024. But also to the whole SCS team and our wonderful community. With you we were able to set up an insightful program with exeptional speakers. With you we will learn about our progress, our future, our partners and dive into the global setup for digital sovereign infrastructure.</p>

      In our upcoming Open Operations Meetup, we delve into the often hidden security risks in software development. Using a low-code platform as an example, we illuminate how thorough security analysis can expose significant flaws that would otherwise remain undiscovered. Do you want to join the discussion?

      Two weeks ago our community gathered at Gonicus in Arnberg at our fourth community hackathon! Besides our intense hacking activities we had some attention from the outside: Maik Außendorfer MdB of Bündnis 90/Grüne visited us to learn about SCS, digital sovereignty and independence. Another visitor was Torsten Koch, editor from Westfalenpost who wrote a great [summary](https://www.wp.de/staedte/arnsberg/article242122804/Hackathon-bei-Gonicus-in-Neheim-Bis-die-Finger-bluten.html) of SCS and our Hackathon. But of course we also produced some great [stuff](https://input.scs.community/Hy0HqULMTGeeVIcy0vmBgA#), like the Status Page.
