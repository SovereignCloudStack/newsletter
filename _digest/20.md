    <p>Remember when we gathered for a Community Run last year? More than thirty
    members of our community competed in a 10K race during the autumn’s Running
    Days. We have proven that Sovereign Cloud Stack is running both — on the
    ground and in the cloud. Thank you for participating in this first athletic
    event within our community!</p>

    <p>Yes, exactly – it’s happening again! We kindly invite you to participate in
    our upcoming Community Triathlon this year. Let’s prove once again that we
    not only perform exceptionally well as technical squads, but also as sports
    teams.</p>

    <p>Like last year there will be shirts for our participants. Sign up now for our
    Community Triathlon, availability of our goodies package is limited. We would
    like to thank B1 Systems GmbH and Univention GmbH for making the shirts
    possible this year!</p>

      can automatically be encrypted and thus protected from unauthorized access
      in SCS.
