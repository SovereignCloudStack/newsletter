intro: |-
  Community,
  <p>this week we had some great discussions with various organizations interested in our community
  and we're looking forward to start working with you! It's great to see how our joint mission is
  accepted and keeps attracting companies, associations and individuals alike. This is also a very
  good occasion to further simplify the entry into our community and to keep the hurdles as low as
  possible. Last week we started to introduce an open calendar that can be collaboratively maintained
  on GitHub. This week we have yet another great announcement: open meeting minutes!</p>
  <p>Read more about our plans to further improve transparency, how OSISM is assuring code quality and
  what else is on the schedule for the upcoming week!</p>

    Felix and Eduard are constantly on the lookout to reduce the barrier of interaction within
    the SCS community and to improve both, transparency and openness. Thus far we did not have
    (aside from the awesome minutes of the weekly community call - thanks Jonas) any real
    established way of consistently taking minutes of the technical team calls. As such,
    Felix will start an experiment for the next few weeks:
      - For each of the technical teams we have an Etherpad where the structure of the meeting
        is layed out upfront (prepared by the PO for the team)
      - Within this Etherpad the minutes are collaboratively taken and afterwards persisted into
        the GitHub repository minutes
      - Most of the items being discussed should be recorded in corresponding GitHub issues
        anyways, for these items a deep-link to the issue will just be added to the Etherpad

      Uniform and well readable code increases readability, understandability, security, quality
      and reusability. However, since every engineer has his own writing style and there are no
      clear guidelines. Ramona has published a post on how OSISM is improving and assuring their
      overall quality.

      From the community of the SCS Operators came the request to have a format where the operators
      are able to interact and share their experiences in operating SCS environments. Felix published
      a post about the last lean coffee session.
