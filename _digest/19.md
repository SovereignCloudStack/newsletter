    Joining an open source community of an already advanced project can be very hard. The high amount
    of existing repositories and information on our website can be overwhelming at first glance. With
    an mentorship program, we want to help newcomers to easily join our teams and lower the barrier
    for contributing to SCS. If you should be interesting in becoming a mentor, please send out a
    short message to Eduard and express your interest in joining our mentorship group. Your commitment
    to this new program will help us to sustainably grow a healthy community that fosters our joint
    mission â€“ putting users and providers in control. Thank you!

      To gain real DevOps and true transparency we introduced the 5th open paradigm:
      Open Operations. That means transparent processes, advanced collaboration,
      error culture, and open documentation. Learn how we want to foster the paradigm
      in this interview with Friederike from The Cloud Report.

      Let's listen to our CTO Kurt Garloff about how SCS puts providers and users
      back in full control of their IT! This is only a first sneak preview of more
      videos that will follow very soon. We would especially like to thank Univention,
      OSISM, and PlusServer for making this campaign possible. Be excited for more
      impressions from the OpenInfra Summit 2022!
