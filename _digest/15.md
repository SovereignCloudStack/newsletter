  Community,
  <p>after a few relaxing holidays we are back in full swing and currently in the
  middle of the first sprints for the next release. The switch to GitHub Projects
  turned out very smoothly and our technical teams have already filled the boards
  with life. Thank you for your important work!
  
  The coming week is all about preparing for Cloud Expo Europe in Frankfurt/Main.
  Besides two exciting presentations by Kurt Garloff and Peter Ganten we are looking
  forward to present the Open Source Business Alliance and our project at booth E155.
  Come by - we would be happy to meet you in person again!</p>

    You are all helping in various ways to make SCS successful and to advance our
    vision of an fully open, federated, compatible platform. Be it through active
    participation in the technical teams or in <b>providing services around SCS</b>.
    As interest in our project grows, so does the demand for specific offerings,
    e.g. integration, consulting or training. We would like to <b>make these
    different services transparent on our website</b> and kindly ask you to
    participate in this survey as soon as possible.
