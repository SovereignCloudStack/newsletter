  <p>Dear Community,</p>
  <p>although we have not been in touch for a while, we were quite busy! We are now in our last last year of our funding and we are preparing the future of SCS. Are you curious? Get all information at our SCS Summit in May! But of course we are also working on our cloud stack, we are quite ahead of the sixth release. And in April we will have our next Community Hackathon. All information and more you find in our digest in March.</p>
  <p> Best wishes,</p>
  <p>Friederike and the SCS team</p>

    <p>To better align the development efforts within our community we started working with outcomes. These outcomes intend to outline what our development work aims to enable our users (Operators, Integrators and End-Users) to gain more value from SCS. This outlines our direction better than talking about the next features that are planned and worked on. Furthermore, the outcomes assist us in our development work to ensure that every single epic and story we work on actually pays into the greater idea: SCS enables, is standardaized, understandible, transparent, opinionated, and continuously built and tested.</p>

    text : |-
      Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a critical component of modern cloud environments, providing the necessary flexibility and scalability to meet the demands of large-scale network infrastructures. As the size and complexity of cloud deployments continue to grow, the need for scalable and efficient SDN solutions becomes increasingly important. In this post, we explore the challenges and strategies for improving SDN scalability within Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) and OpenStack environments.
