    text : |-
      Team dNation started two important discussions on finding the best approach for a container registry as-a-service
      solution:
      <ul><li>Is the shared-storage model in Harbor a limitation for CSPs?</li>
      <li>Which container registry use cases are relevant for CSPs?</li></ul>
      Your feedback is highly appreciated and helps us a lot!
