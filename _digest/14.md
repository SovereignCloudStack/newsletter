    You're complaints have been heard. We decided to give GitHub projects a shot
    so that we can offer you a single entry point for contributing. The upcoming
    release will be planned in the public "Sovereign Cloud Stack R3" project on
    GitHub. With this attempt we hope not only to reduce the number of tools,
    but also to make our work more transparent and traceable!
