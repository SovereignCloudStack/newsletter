  Community,
  <p> we're already back in full work mode and are preparing for the upcoming
  development of R3. The retrospectives have helped us a lot to further optimize
  this process. This digest is to inform you about the upcoming changes and what
  else we have planned to make our community experience amazing. See you soon during
  our team meetings!</p>

    Your complaints have been heard. We decided to give GitHub projects a shot
    so that we can offer you a single entry point for contributing. The upcoming
    release will be planned in the public "Sovereign Cloud Stack R3" project on
    GitHub. With this attempt we hope not only to reduce the number of tools,
    but also to make our work more transparent and traceable!

      After the successful release of R2, we conducted retrospectives in the
      teams last week. Thank you for the trustful exchange and the exciting
      results. It is now up to all of us to implement these good ideas as part
      of a continuous improvement process. The links on the slides will take you
      to the detailed boards. We're now looking forward to the planning of R3
      and our daily work.

      We would like to use the start of the new release cycle to have a critical
      review of our common "Definition of Done". Kurt has made a very good first
      submission and is appreciating any feedback or amendments. This list will
      extend our standard template for new user stories and contribute to the
      quality of our development work.
