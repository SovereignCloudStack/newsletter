  Community,<br/><br/>
  the new year has hardly begun and we are already busy planning this year's 
  events. We do hope so much to meet you physically after the many months of 
  virtual collaboration. Whether OpenInfra Summit in Berlin or Cloud Expo in 
  Frankfurt, we will be there and hope to see you as well! Let's finally toast 
  together and celebrate the many successes of the past year.<br/><br/>
  What are your plans for 2022? Is there an event you are most looking forward
  to and where will we be able to spot you?
