    <p>We‚Äôve recently published Release 3 and with that we immediately started
    our R4 cycle. While the majority of planning is done in our team meetings,
    Kurt, Christian and Felix prepared some initial work.</p>

    <p>Features, functionality and what they offer to SCS Operators and Users are
    the heart of development and the level on which we often discuss in the planning
    sessions. Features as part of user stories come together in epics. When we look
    at SCS and the releases, we don‚Äôt just want to ‚Äúthrow a bunch of features over
    the fence‚Äù. We want to enable operators of cloud computing infrastructure, we
    want to provide building blocks for digital sovereignty for operators to provide
    innovative offers to their customers. The outcomes for our stakeholders,
    primarily the operators, is what we focus on when describing our goals for R4.</p>
