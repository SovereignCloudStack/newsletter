intro: |-
  <p>Dear community,</p>
  <p>During the last weeks, I have spent a lot of my time looking back, making sure we have
  recorded all the outcomes of our joint work, so none of great contributions get lost.
  We have to write a report, and this consumed quite some attention. So if you experienced the
  SCS project team not being as responsive as it should have been, you now know why.<br/>
  The benefit of looking back is that I can see how much we have achieved together, and, yes,
  it makes me proud. We started out with the mourning how much we are losing control
  over IT platforms by outsourcing it to opaque platform providers from increasingly far away.
  Open Source had allowed us to regain control over our local IT with an OSS operating system
  ecosystem and to foster the rise of the modern internet-based technology explosion thanks to
  *permissionless innovation*. We needed to translate this now into a world of cloud
  platforms and SCS was our attempt to contribute to this.<br/>
  We were lucky to gain funding from the German government, to find an engaged and skilled
  community, to hire smart and engaged people into our team and to be able to build on top of
  amazing upstream communities. We refined our thinking on the vision and created these three
  pillars *Certifiable Standards*, *Modular OSS implementation* and *Open Operations*
  with the associated *SCS-compatible*, *SCS-open* and *SCS-sovereign* labels that certify
  these. We built a lot of software, tests, documentation, standards. And not just for
  the sake of it, but for operators that are using the results, every day, in their
  production setups, such are the Bayern Cloud Schule (ByCS) that serves hundreds of
  thousands students every day built on top of PlusCloudOpen, using SCS technology.
  We created quite some awareness for what we do by writing articles, visiting conferences
  and even creating our own SCS Summits. Digital Sovereignty is a major topic these days,
  for better or worse.</br>
  With the end of the year, the funding period is over; the work will go on in a new
  shape. Not everything is fully worked out yet, but with the Forum SCS-Standards in
  the OSBA (see below) we have one major pillar (the *Certifiable Standards*) that's
  in very good shape already. And the interest in our approach, our standards, our
  technology is higher than ever, where we have increasing interest from neighbour
  countries and even the international level with the GovStack project (see below) and
  joint work with the UNICC.<br/>
  It's been a privilege to be in a driver position for this great project -- definitely
  the most rewarding one I have been involved within my life. Thanks for contributing
  and making this such a wonderful and successful project! I will stay involved,
  supporting the Forum where I can and building my own little business S7n Cloud
  Services GmbH, which will support the technology partners and operators with
  engineering, integration and consulting services. The end of the funded project is
  the start of the next stage and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with
  hopefully many of you and hopefully also quite some new community members and partners!
  </p>
  <p>Enjoy reading the digest, have a great christmas break and see you next year,</p>
  <p>Kurt</p>

    <p>We will continue developing and improving the SCS reference implementation with partners, users, and the wonderful community. The governance of the open source project and the GitHub org will be covered by the new SCS Project Board which will be elected in January. In close collaboration with the Forum SCS Standards this will ensure the quality and continuity of SCS. Find the candidates for the voting <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Community-Governance/2024-12-project-board-nominees.md">here</a>.</p>

      At the general meeting of the OSBA this year the last step was taken to found the Forum SCS Standards. The Forum will take care of developing and spreading the SCS Standards for cloud computing to enable and strengthen open and, if needed, federated networks of cloud providers and interoperability. This is a demand of the German Government Cloud, but not just of them. This will foster cloud computing in Europe and beyond, to build an alternative to hyperscalers and to get more digital sovereignity.

      As Kurt mentioned (see above) SCS was very productive also in writing articles, giving talks, having events, ... A lot of the results you find in our YouTube channel where we published 84 videos about SCS, about our partners, our achievements, our technology, and the SCS usage. Sneak in and enjoy!

      ALASCA e.V. was founded as association for operational, open cloud infrastructures, so the collaboration with SCS was obvious. Now, ALASCA received funding from the Saxon State Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Transport (SMWA), to drive the further development, piloting and dissemination of open source software and standards for cloud services within the Saxon ecosystem. And they will use SCS technology to achieve this goal. And of course the SCS community will support the project!

      During the last year SCS was part of the GovStack community and contributed to the Cloud Infrastructure Building Block, defining vendor-neutral requirements for sovereign cloud & container infrastructure. The SCS implementation has now been listed as the first compliant implementation in the GovStack marketplace. And we are very happy to continue our collaboration to support states in offering digital services to their citizens by pursuing their digital transformation and building their own sovereign cloud environments.

      We are delighted to announce that the SCS project has been endorsed as a Lighthouse Project by the Gaia X Association. As such the association acknowledges that SCS actively contributes to the principles and standards of Gaia X, their distribution and adoption. At the core these shall enable and suppport open, non-proprietary ecosystems for data exchange within and across business and industry sectors.
