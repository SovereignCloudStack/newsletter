      overwhelmed by the impressions of those three days at the Berlin Conference
      Center (bcc). Felix and Eduard have published a blog post with some recordings
      worth seeing and a personal recap of this exciting event.

      Kurt was invited to talk about digital sovereignty and SCS at the
      <i>Parldigi-Dinner</i> in Bern. The parliamentary group "Digital Sustainability"
      promotes the digitally sustainable usage of commons through parliamentary
      initiatives, dinner events, open hearings, media releases and blog entries.
      Check out the recording available on YouTube, which gives a very good overview
      of SCS and our joint mission.
